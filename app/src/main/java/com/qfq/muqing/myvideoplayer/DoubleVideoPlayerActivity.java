 * One key feature is that the video decoders do not stop when the activity is restarted due
 * to an orientation change.  This is to simulate playback of a real-time video stream.  If
 * the Activity is pausing because it's "finished" (indicating that we're leaving the Activity
 * for a nontrivial amount of time), the video decoders are shut down.
 * <p>
 * TODO: consider shutting down when the screen is turned off, to preserve battery.
